RMM Level 1 introduces "identifiers", but they can be completely unconstrained.

http://example.com/account/deposit?value=500

RMM Level 2 (HTTP constraints) will shape how those are actually used.

Many REST APIs require you to read their API layout in order to have your code know how to invoke it:

http://flickr.com/api/foo/baz/bat/term=dog

but this will break things if your code learns the old way and then they change it:

http://flickr.com/api/foo/bat/baz/term=dog

Clients should "learn things" from the representations. They will be less tightly-coupled then.

Stable identifiers will draw attention. Here is the example of the "index based upon image properties link":

That works because Flickr uses stable identifiers. Otherwise, it wouldn't be in the Retrievr folks' interest to build something that depends upon another system.

We want to build Resource-Oriented Architectures that are stable so people will find value in what we produce beyond our initial usage.
